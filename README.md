SM runs on LAMP or LEMP stacks. It requires MySQL 5 and PHP 7.

## Collaborating

If you are looking to collaborate with the project, you are more than welcome!

Easiest thing is to start with the open issues. But since it is a very early stage in the project, there are much more things to do! Feel free to drop me a line to dfgonzalez@gmail.com with your ideas, suggestions and we'll find a match for you to improve the product.
